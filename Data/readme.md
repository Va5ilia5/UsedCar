# Used Car Evaluation

Cars are a vital element of our daily lives. There are several types of automobiles created by various manufacturers; the customer must then make a selection. When an individual considers purchasing a car, there are various factors that may impact his/her decision on the type of automobile he/she is interested in. The decision that a buyer or driver makes is usually based on the price, safety, and how nice and spacious the automobile is. In the used automobile retail industry, this paper objectively assesses the influence of reference prices on customer purchase choices. Given the growing importance of the used vehicle market in internet auctions, this study adds on existing research on online auction markets to see how mileage and seller attributes influence the price premium on used cars (Richardson.M, 2009). The subject of the paper will be on relatively low-priced homogenous products and auction characteristics, as well as how to fit them into three distinct generic linear models.
