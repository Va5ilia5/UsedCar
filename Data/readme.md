# Used Car Evaluation

This model will be based on quantitative and categorical data. Edmunds API was utilised as the source. That's what I used to obtain information from the website. With the help of these sources, data about the price of a car—both new and used—as well as its age, mileage, manufacture, condition, miles per gallon, safety ratings, and hybrid technology will be obtained. These variables will enable a generalized linear model to be performed and an equation to be calculated.
